<h3 class="" data-end="993" data-start="964">What is a Penile Implant?</h3>
<p class="" data-end="1317" data-start="995">A penile implant, also referred to as penile prosthesis, is a medical device surgically placed inside the penis to allow men with erectile dysfunction (ED) to achieve an erection. The implant can also be used by individuals who have experienced trauma, or certain conditions, that affect the natural function of the penis.</p>
<p class="" data-end="1373" data-start="1319">There are several types of penile implants, including:</p>
<ol data-end="2068" data-start="1375">
<li class="" data-end="1626" data-start="1375">
<p class="" data-end="1626" data-start="1378"><strong data-end="1401" data-start="1378">Inflatable Implants</strong>: These are the most common type. They consist of two cylinders inserted into the penis, a pump placed in the scrotum, and a reservoir implanted in the abdomen. The pump is used to inflate the cylinders, creating an erection.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="1824" data-start="1630">
<p class="" data-end="1824" data-start="1633"><strong data-end="1656" data-start="1633">Semi-Rigid Implants</strong>: These are bendable rods that are inserted into the penis. They don’t require a pump, and while the penis remains firm, it can be manually bent for easier concealment.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="2068" data-start="1826">
<p class="" data-end="2068" data-start="1829"><strong data-end="1867" data-start="1829">Self-Contained Inflatable Implants</strong>: This option combines the components of the inflatable implant into one device, making it simpler for patients to use. This device has a pump inside the penis, allowing for a more streamlined process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="" data-end="2273" data-start="2070">Dr. Miami is known for offering the most advanced and effective penile implant procedures, catering to a wide range of patients seeking either functional or aesthetic improvements in their sexual health.</p><p class="" data-end="2273" data-start="2070"><b><a href="https://iherbpharma.com/Dr.Miami" target="_blank">Tired of Small Penis ‘Just Okay’?
